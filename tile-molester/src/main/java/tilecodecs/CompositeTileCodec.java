*
* Composite tile codec.
* A <code>composite</code> tile is a tile that is built up of several
* standard tiles. As an example, consider a 3bpp tile that consists
* of a single 2bpp non-interleaved tile followed by a single 1bpp tile.
* Such a format cannot be accommodated by the standard planar tile codec
* (PlanarTileCodec). However, it can be accommodated by instantiating several
* PlanarTileCodecs, decoding planar tiles separately and then "overlaying" them
* on top of each other. This class provides just this kind of functionality.
* It allows more flexibility in the tile formats, but is probably a bit
* slower.
