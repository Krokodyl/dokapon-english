マニー = Cash

Cash is Princess Penny's dog in Dokapon Kingdom.
He is introduced in Chapter 1 of the Story Mode after he eats a poisoned doughnut, and the adventurers have to find the Antidote for him.
The Antidote is given to an adventurer when they land on the space occupied by the Wise Grandma, an NPC that appears on Asiana after Cash is poisoned.
Returning the Antidote awards the deed for Khan's Castle and advances the story to Chapter 2.
