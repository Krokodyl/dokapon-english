/**
*
* Linear palette-indexed 8x8 tile codec. Max. 8 bits per pixel.
* bitsPerPixel mod 2 = 0 (so only 1, 2, 4, 8bpp possible).
*
* Some notes on "pixel ordering":
*
* I define pixel order for a row like so: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
* In other words, pixels are numbered from leftmost to rightmost,
* as they appear on screen.
* I define bit order in a byte like so: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0.
* In other words, bits are numbered from rightmost (high) to leftmost (low).
*
* For formats with less than 8 bits per pixel, it is then an
* issue how bits are extracted from the bytes of encoded tile data
* to form the order of pixels stated above.
*
* Note that this applies at the PIXEL-level, not bit-, byte- or row-level;
* this is why ordering is not an issue for 8bpp tiles, since each byte
* contains only one pixel. It is assumed that the bytes themselves are
* always stored in-order (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). Similary, it is assumed that
* the individual bits of a pixel are always stored from high -> low.
*
* The familiar terms "little endian" and "big endian" are not appropriate to
* use here, as I consider them to apply at the byte-level. To avoid any
* confusion or ambiguity, I therefore use the expressions "in-order" and
* "reverse-order" to refer to the ordering of pixels within a byte.
* This is still a bit tricky since the order of pixels and bits above are
* reverses of eachother to begin with, but shouldn't be too confusing:
*
* I define "in-order" to mean that the order of pixel data as stored in a byte
* complies with the order of pixels to be rendered, from left to right. For
* 1bpp, this is simple: in-order means that bit 7 corresponds to pixel 0,
* bit 6 to pixel 1 and so on. Reverse-order means that bit 7 corresponds to
* pixel 7, bit 6 corresponds to pixel 6 and so on (in other words, the bits
* have to be reversed from left to right in order for the pixel order to be
* correct). Diagrammatically:
*
* Pixels: 01234567
*         |||||||| (In-order)
* Bits:   76543210
*
* Pixels: 01234567
*         |||||||| (Reverse-order)
* Bits:   01234567
*
* This extends quite intuitively to the cases of 2 and 4 bits per pixel.
* I will give one example of each.
*
* 2bpp, in-order:
*
* Pixels: 0  1  2  3
*         |  |  |  |
* Bits:   76 54 32 10
*
* 4bpp, reverse-order:
*
* Pixels: 0     1
*         |     |
* Bits:   3210  7654
