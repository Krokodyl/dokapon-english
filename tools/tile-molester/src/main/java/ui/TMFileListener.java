/**
*
* Abstract class that defines the interface for filelisteners.
* A <code>filelistener</code> is an object that is notified when a file has
* been fully loaded into memory, as well as when it is about to be saved.
* At these times it may perform various operations on the data being saved,
* such as repairing checksums.
* The fileformatlistener also has to implement a method that determines if
* the file being saved is indeed of a supported format. This usually involves
* checking the header (verifying ID strings and such).

* listener a chance to detect the file format. If it returns <code>true</code>,
